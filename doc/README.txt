               Observatory Boller and Chivens Spectrograph in
               2014. Example of 1st exercise with a
               spectrograph. Focus Cals, and make views for each main
               setting. Here p and m are plus and minus; d and m are
               for degrees and minutes. The spectrograph has a
               vernier, red to every 1/4 of a degree so m8d30m would
               be -8 degrees 30 minutes.
