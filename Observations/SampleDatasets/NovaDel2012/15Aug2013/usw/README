We report high resolution results (0.23A at 6563A) 
results for the newly announced nova Del 2013 = PNV J20233073+2046041. 


These extend the report by Darnley et al. (ATEL #5279) based on low
resolution spectra. Our grating spectra, obtained on 2013 Aug. 14.87
with the coude spectrograph at the 2 meter Zeiss telescope of the
Ondrejov Observatory, shows strong H-alpha emission with a P Cyg
profile extending to a maximum radial velocities of -2300 km/s
(absorption, EW approx 8.1A) and +2400 km/s (emission, EW \approx
52.9A) with no terminal edge at high negative velocity. The emission
is broad, asymmetric (stronger blueward) and now structureless. The He
I 6678 appears to show a detached absorption feature at -870 km/s
without strong emission. In contrast, He I 5875 shows a strong P Cyg
line with velocities similar to H\alpha. Both components of Si II
6347, 6371 (RMT 2, see Williams, R. E. 2012, AJ, 144, 98) are present
in absorption with vrad \approx -1100 km/s; Fe II 6456, and N I 6486
also appear to be present with vrad \approx -1100 and -960 km/s,
respectively. The spectrum is typical of a classical nova -- possibly
CO type -- in the early (optically thick) fireball stage but with
indications of the onset of the recombination event (e.g. Shore et
al. 2012, A&A, 537, C2) , based on weak displaced broad absorption
from the Na I D lines. The interstellar components of Na I D are not
saturated, suggesting the extinction is relatively low. The LAB H I 21
cm profile (Kalberla, P.M.W. et al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775) has a total
HI column density of 1.15E21/ccm^2 at a peak v(LSR)=14.1 km/s, 


this is
likely an upper limit since the 21 cm profile is broad. Observations
are continuing and we strongly encourage continuing spectroscopic
monitoring, especially in the infrared.
